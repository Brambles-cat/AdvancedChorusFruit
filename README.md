Plugin works but I'm still going to add a few features, open to suggestions on what to add or change

Sorry about the terrible github managing n stuff I don't rly know how to use much of it conventionally

Intstructions:
- to set a warp location, name an eye of ender "set (location name)" and then burn it at the desired location
- name a chorus fruit "warp (location name)" then once you eat it, it'll take you to that location
 
Commands:
- removelocation (location name)
removes a warp locations data by name from the dimesnion the command was executed in

- listlocations
Sends the player a list of all warp locations in their current dimension

- setopexclusive (true/false)
Sets whether only server operators can delete or set warp locations

() are for placeholder values


PLANS: (ordered by priority)

1. ~~Teleportation working in Nether and End dimensions~~ done
2. ~~Player direction facing saving when teleporting~~ done
3. ~~Listlocations displays current dimension's warp points~~ done
4. ~~item lore for chorus fruit and ender eyes with 'set ' and 'warp ' display name starters to make it look fancy~~ done
5. ~~Admin configs for certain commands or fruit plugin usage~~ done
7. ~~Command arguments thing~~ done
8. Fix rain message spam
9. Add particle effects when setting warp points
