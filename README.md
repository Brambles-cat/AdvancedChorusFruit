Plugin works but I'm ~~still going to add a few features~~ open to suggestions on what to add or change

Discord: Smol Ascended Bee#5061
Sorry about the terrible github managing n stuff I don't rly know how to use much of it conventionally

Intstructions:
- to set a warp location, name an eye of ender "set (location name)" and then burn it at the desired location
- name a chorus fruit "warp (location name)" then once you eat it, it'll take you to that location
 
Commands:
- removelocation (location name)
removes a warp locations data by name from the dimesnion the command was executed in

- listlocations
Sends the player a list of all warp locations in their current dimension

Don't leave in the () characters


PLANS: (ordered by priority)

1. ~~Make teleportation work in Nether and End dimensions~~ complete!
2. ~~Fix direction the player faces when teleporting~~ ~~complete-ish.... kind of?~~ completely completed!
3. ~~Once above is completed, only show locations in listlocations cmd of warp locations set in the dimension the player is in~~ complete!
4. ~~item lore for chorus fruit and ender eyes with 'set ' and 'warp ' display name starters to make it look fancy~~ complete!
5. ~~Use hashmaps, which won't really affect anything except probably making my code cleaner~~ complete!
