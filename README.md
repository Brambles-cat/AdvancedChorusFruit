Plugin works but I'm still going to add a few features

Discord: Smol Ascended Bee#5061
Sorry about the terrible github managing n stuff I don't rly know how to use much of it conventionally

Intstructions:
- to set a warp location, burn an eye of ender with a displayname that starts with 'set ' followed by the name for the location you want to set it as
- name a chorus fruit 'warp ' followed by the warp locations name you set. Once you eat it, it'll take you to that location
 
Commands:
- removelocation (location name)
removes a warp locations data by name from the dimesnion the command was executed in

- listlocations
Sends the player a list of all warp locations in their current dimension

Omit () when using commands


PLANS: (ordered by priority)

1. ~~Make teleportation work in Nether and End dimensions~~ complete!
2. ~~Fix direction the player faces when teleporting~~ complete-ish.... kind of?
3. ~~Once above is completed, only show locations in listlocations cmd of warp locations set in the dimension the player is in~~ complete!
4. item lore for chorus fruit and ender eyes with 'set ' and 'warp ' display name starters to make it look fancy
