Plugin works but I'm still going to add a few features, open to suggestions on what to add or change

Sorry about the terrible github managing n stuff I don't rly know how to use much of it conventionally

Intstructions:
- to set a warp location, name an eye of ender "set (location name)" and then burn it at the desired location
- name a chorus fruit "warp (location name)" then once you eat it, it'll take you to that location
 
Commands:
- removelocation (location name)
removes a warp locations data by name from the dimesnion the command was executed in

- listlocations
Sends the player a list of all warp locations in their current dimension

() are for placeholder values


PLANS: (ordered by priority)

1. ~~Make teleportation work in Nether and End dimensions~~ done
2. ~~Fix direction the player faces when teleporting~~ done
3. ~~Once above is completed, only show locations in listlocations cmd of warp locations set in the dimension the player is in~~ done
4. ~~item lore for chorus fruit and ender eyes with 'set ' and 'warp ' display name starters to make it look fancy~~ done
5. ~~Use hashmaps, which won't really affect anything except probably making my code cleaner~~ done
6. Make admin config making fruit usable for admins and non admins
7. Make plugin work with other dimensions from modifications
8. Command argument for server command prompt to choose which dimension to remove location from
