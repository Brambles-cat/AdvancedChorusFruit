~~Uhhh so so far this plugin doesn't rly work but i'm working on it~~ 
Plugin now actually works, but isn't that great yet

Discord: Smol Ascended Bee#5061

NOTE : chorus fruits aren't working rn so for now it uses golden apples as placeholders

Intstructions:
- to set a warp location, burn an eye of ender with a displayname that starts with 'set ' followed by the name for the location you want to set it as
- name a golden apple 'warp ' followed by the warp locations name you set. Once you eat it, it'll take you to that location


PLANS: (ordered by priority)

1. Check if warp location name exists when burning eye -> changes coordinates for that name if it does, ignores if it's in the same place
2. Commands for showing a list of warp locations and their names, and one for deleting warp locations
3. item lore for golden apples and ender eyes with 'set ' and 'warp ' to make it look fancy
