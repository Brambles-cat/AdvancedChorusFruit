Plugin works but I'm still going to add a few features, open to suggestions on what to add or change

Sorry about the terrible github managing n stuff I don't rly know how to use much of it conventionally

Intstructions:
- to set a warp point, name an eye of ender "set (location name)" and then burn it at the desired location
- name a chorus fruit "warp (location name)" then, once eaten, it'll take you to that location
 
Commands:
- removewarp (location name)
removes a warp points data by name from the dimension the command was executed in

- listwarps
Sends the player a list of all warp locations in their current dimension

- permission (give/list/remove) (player) [permission] // [] if it isn't list
Sets what functions or commands players are allowed to use with the plugin

Permissions:
 - All - All permissions except NoWarping
 - Set_Warps - Allow setting warp points
 - Remove_Warps - Allow removing of existing warp points
 - Listing - Allow seeing a list of all warp points
 - No_Warping - Disallows using warp points by eating chorus fruit

() are for placeholder values
